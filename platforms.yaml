# This file specifies image customizations that are specific to particular
# architecture/platform pairs.  It is applied (indirectly, via
# /boot/coreos/platforms.json) by create_disk.sh and gf-set-platform at
# build time and coreos-installer at install time (if --platform is
# specified).
#
# Currently this is used to configure the default console.  For any
# arch/platform pairs not specified, GRUB and the kernel will apply their
# own defaults.  Note that coreos-installer install --console will
# completely override any GRUB commands specified here.
#
# s390x doesn't use GRUB and requires running zipl after updating kargs,
# so it can't be added to this file without additional development work.
#
# All architectures, platforms, and fields are optional.
